Technical Indicators Visualization: Implemented a dashboard using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. The dashboard allows users to visualize various technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, SMA, and EMA for a given stock symbol.
Data Retrieval and Processing: Utilized Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) to fetch historical stock price data based on user input. Preprocessed the data to extract relevant features and calculate technical indicators required for analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Integrated machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, K Neighbors Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor for predicting future stock prices. Trained and evaluated these models using historical stock price data.
Prediction Results: Implemented functionality to display predicted stock prices for a specified number of days into the future. Evaluated prediction performance using metrics such as R2 Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model accuracy.
User Interaction: Provided a user-friendly interface allowing users to choose between visualizing technical indicators, exploring recent stock data, and making predictions. Integrated interactive widgets for user input and result display.
