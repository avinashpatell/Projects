# Technical Indicators Visualization: 
Implemented a dashboard using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. The dashboard allows users to visualize various technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, SMA, and EMA for a given stock symbol.
# Data Retrieval and Processing: 
Utilized Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) to fetch historical stock price data based on user input. Preprocessed the data to extract relevant features and calculate technical indicators required for analysis.
# Machine Learning Models: 
Integrated machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, K Neighbors Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor for predicting future stock prices. Trained and evaluated these models using historical stock price data.
# Prediction Results: 
Implemented functionality to display predicted stock prices for a specified number of days into the future. Evaluated prediction performance using metrics such as R2 Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model accuracy.
# User Interaction: 
Provided a user-friendly interface allowing users to choose between visualizing technical indicators, exploring recent stock data, and making predictions. Integrated interactive widgets for user input and result display.
